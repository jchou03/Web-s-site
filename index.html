                   About Dtech:
                </h4>
			    <p>
                    d.tech is a design based school that seems like a weeb/gamer school but actually doesn't have that many weebs or gamers. The reason that our school seems like there are lots of gamers is because the gamers that are at d.tech are really open about it. d.tech has a lot of good tech and teachers so we have quite a few coders out of the 550 students and not as many jocks because we don't have a field or as much sports focus.
